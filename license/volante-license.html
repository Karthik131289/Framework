<li><b>Restricted Use for Evaluation</b>
<p>This Software Product can be used in conjunction with a free evaluation Software Product License. If you are using such an evaluation Software Product License, you may use the Software Product only to evaluate its suitability for purchase. Evaluation Software has been limited in some way either through timeouts, restricted use or evaluation warnings.

Any supplemental software code or related materials that Volante Technologies provides to you as part of the support services, in periodic updates to the Software Product or otherwise, is to be considered part of the Software Product and is subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA.
With respect to any technical information you provide to Volante Technologies as part of the support services, Volante Technologies may use such information for its business purposes without restriction, including for product support and development. Volante Technologies will not use such technical information in a form that personally identifies you without first obtaining your permission.

<li><b>Restrictions</b>
<p>You may not use, copy, or distribute the Software Product, except as granted by this EULA, without written authorization from Volante Technologies.
You may not tamper with, alter, or use the Software Product in a way that disables, circumvents, or otherwise defeats its built-in licensing verification and enforcement capabilities.
You may not remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notice, legend, symbol or label in the Software Product. You may not modify or create derivative copies of the Software Product License.
You may not reverse engineer, decompile, defeat license encryption mechanisms, or disassemble the Software Product or Software Product License except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. You may not rent, lease, lend, or in any way distribute or transfer any rights in this EULA or the Software Product to third parties without Volante Technologies' written approval, and subject to written agreement by the recipient of the terms of this EULA.
The Software Product is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, in which the failure of the Software Product, or any software, tool, process, or service that was developed using the Software Product, could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage ("High Risk Activities"). Accordingly, Volante Technologies and its suppliers and licensors specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities. You agree that Volante Technologies and its suppliers and licensors will not be liable for any claims or damages arising from the use of the Software Product, or any software, tool, process, or service that was developed using the Software Product, in such applications.

<li><b>Third Party Rights</b>
<p>Any software provided along with the Software Product that is associated with a separate license agreement is licensed to you under the terms of that license agreement. This license does not apply to those portions of the Software Product. Copies of these third party licenses are included in all copies of the Software Product.

<li><b>Limited Warranty</b>
<p>You have ensured with the above mentioned evaluation version that the Software Product works according to your requirements and the advertised features. Volante Technologies disclaims all warranties for deficiencies that are reasonably discoverable with the evaluation version of the Software Product.

The limitation period is one year, if not otherwise regulated by law, and starts with the service provision.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Volante Technologies and its third party suppliers and licensors disclaim all other representations, warranties, and conditions, expressed, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. The entire risk arising out of use or performance of the software product remains with you.

<li><b>Limitation of Liability</b>
<p>This limitation of liability is to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Volante Technologies is liable to indemnity only according to the following terms:
Volante Technologies is fully liable in case of intention, gross negligence, loss from physical injury, severe organizational failure or in case of an acceptance of guarantee.
Liability for slight negligence is limited to material breach of contractual obligations and in that case to the typically predictable loss. Any further liability is excluded. Contributory negligence of the licensee and other parties will be taken into account. Any liability under the terms of product liability laws remains unaffected.
You agree to ensure that a data backup is performed on all computers that the Software Product or redistributable parts of it are used on. In case of loss of data, liability is limited to the cost that would arise in the case where a proper backup has been performed.
The limitation period is one year, if not otherwise regulated by law, and starts with the service provision.
Any limitation of Volante Technologies' liability also applies to your staff, agents and associated companies.
